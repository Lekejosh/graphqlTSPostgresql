## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, make sure you have:

- Forked the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Cloned your forked repository to your local development environment.
- Installed the necessary dependencies and set up the development environment as described in the README.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create an Issue**: If you have a bug report, feature request, or any other non-trivial change, please start by creating an issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lekejosh/graphqlTSPostgresql/issues) page. Describe the problem or feature you're working on and provide any relevant details.

2. **Branching**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a clear and descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-number`.

3. **Coding Guidelines**: Follow the coding style and guidelines specified in the project's README and any additional guidelines mentioned in the relevant section of the codebase.

4. **Commits**: Make your commits descriptive and clear, following best practices for commit messages. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature"). Reference the issue number in your commit message if applicable (e.g., "Fix #123").

5. **Pull Request**: Once your contribution is ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository. Ensure your pull request includes a clear and concise description of the changes you've made. If your pull request addresses an issue, reference that issue in your pull request description.

6. **Review**: Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and contributors. Be prepared to make necessary changes based on feedback and engage in discussions as needed.

7. **Testing**: Ensure that your changes do not introduce new bugs and that existing tests pass. If relevant, write new tests to cover your code changes.

8. **Documentation**: Update the documentation as needed to reflect your changes. This includes updating README files, code comments, and any relevant documentation files.

9. **Merging**: Once your pull request is approved and passes all checks, it will be merged into the `main` branch. Afterward, it will be included in the next release.
