## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js:** You need Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lekejosh/graphqlTSPostgresql.git
   ```

````

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd graphqlTSPostgresql
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

You will need to configure the API according to your environment. Edit the configuration file (`.env`) to set up your database connection and other environment-specific variables.

### Starting the API

Start the API server with the following command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the API will run on `http://localhost:5000/graphql`. You can access the GraphQL Playground at this URL to interact with the API.
